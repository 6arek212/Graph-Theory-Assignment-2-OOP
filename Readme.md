#### A part of university assignment


</br>


## Project Overview
Implementing weighted graph data structure alongside known graph algorithms 
and a simple GUI

</br>

## What is needed to be done

- ### Graph 

    - Add node
    - Delete node
    - Add edge 
    - Delete edge
    - iterate through all the nodes 
    - iterate through all the edges 

  
- ### Algorithms 

    - Shortest path between two nodes 
    - The center node
    - Travelling salesman problem
    - Strongly connected


- ### Json 
   
    - Load json graph
    - Save graph as json

</br>


## Algorithms Implementation 

- `Dijkstra Algorithm` for the shortest path between two nodes O(|V|*|V|)  
- `Strongly connected components` to check weither the graph
is connected there must be only **One** strongly connected component O(|V|+|E|)
- center algorithm using the shortest path O(|V| * |V| * |V|)



</br>


# Example 
    Running the shortest path algorithm "Dijkstra Algorithm"  
</br>
