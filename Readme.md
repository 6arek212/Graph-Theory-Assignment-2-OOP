# Graph Theory Assignment


## Project Overview
Implementing weighted graph data structure alongside known graph algorithms 
and a simple GUI


## What is needed to be done

- Graph Implementation

    - Add node
    - Delete node
    - Add edge 
    - Delete edge
    - iterate through all the nodes 
    - iterate through all the edges 

  
- Algorithms Implementation

    - Shortest path between two nodes **" Dijkstra Algorithm "**
    - The center node
    - Travelling salesman problem
    - Strongly connected


- Json functions
   
    - Load json graph
    - Save graph as json



# Example 
    Running the shortest path algorithm "Dijkstra Algorithm"
